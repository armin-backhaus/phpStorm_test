# Watch me
... if you wish to get beyond being "only" a simple programmer

## How to get the most out of such videos
Only watch in your spare time!  
Only watch if you have room, time and silence (around and inside you)!  
Maximum is one video per day and two per week!
Make sure to really understand everything by pausing,
winding back, rewatch etc.  

The goal is to get the several parts the videos discuss
in your head as complete pictures,
at least at the time you are watching them.
Forgetting details ist OK as long
as the main information/ideas get kind of stuck and 
helps you understand how thing play together.

As always: Don't overdo it, KISS and write down
questions to discuss tem later.  
And most important: stay curious and have fun!
